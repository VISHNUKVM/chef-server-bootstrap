Chef Server Bootstrap
=====================

The shell script bootstrap.sh sets up a chef server using chef-solo for ongoing maintainability. You can continue to manage the server using chef-solo, rather than it being a one off.

Currently the script is only tested with Debain Squeeze but should work with Ubuntu. Please feel free to report errors or send pull requests.
